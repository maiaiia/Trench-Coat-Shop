# Trench Coat Shop

A C++ application for managing a trench coat shop with a GUI built using the Qt framework. This project was developed as part of an OOP course during my 2nd semester of studying Computer Science at UBB Cluj, as a way of both learning and applying fundamental software engineering principles and modern C++ practices.
